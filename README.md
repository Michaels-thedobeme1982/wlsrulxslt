Man, just walked out of The Life List and I’m in that weird post-movie haze where you're not entirely sure if what you just saw was genius or a fever dream. You know those movies where you feel like you’ve lived another life in two hours and you need a nap but also have an existential crisis the size of Jupiter? Yeah, that. 

I mean, first of all, whatever caffeine fairies possessed the director, I want some of that energy. The movie jumps around like a kangaroo on a pogo stick. One minute you’re on a rooftop in what looks like a Hollywood fever dream, next you’re in a tiny cafe with lighting dim enough to lose your soul. Also, there’s this guy, kinda wish I was him, with his list—his life's checklist of dreams? Or regrets? Still not sure. Now, what was the deal with that camera angle in the dance scene? Do I need to tilt my head sideways or buy a new set of eyeballs? 

> The plot though, had all the subtlety of a marching band in a library. “Find your purpose!” they say, like a broken record. But at 90 mins in, I'm just waiting for someone to spill a drink just to shake things up. 

And can we talk about the lead actor’s eyes for a second? Holy nuances, Batman. One look and I'm convinced he's seen the inside of my very soul, or at least my kitchen on a bad day. But, real talk, his chemistry with the love interest was like watching two wet socks trying to spark a fire. 

Here's a weird thought, what if life's purpose is like downloading the proverbial movie of our existence? And once you hit play, it's all just buffering with occasional bursts of clarity?

```python
# I think this is what my brain was doing after the second plot twist
life_purpose = None
while not life_purpose:
    try:
        # attempts to realize life's purpose
        pass
    except ExistentialCrisisError:
        life_purpose = drink coffee
```

Anyway, if you're up for a ride that leaves you slightly winded but still wanting to download the movie in your brain and dissect it scene by scene, go watch The Life List. It's messy and chaotic and maybe even a little brilliant. Just don’t forget to breathe occasionally when the screen suggests otherwise. I might need another coffee. Or maybe just stick my head in a freezer for a bit.
